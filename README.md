## 📊 Project Overview

**Admin Dashboard** is a centralized internal **log viewer platform** built with **Next.js** and **React.js** ⚛️.  
It provides admins and developers with a unified interface to **view, filter, and analyze logs** 🧾 generated by different company modules, including the **Backend (Django)** 🐍, **Website**, and **Database** 💾 systems.

The application enables **real-time visibility** into system activity ⏱️, making it easier to **track deployments**, **detect issues**, and **ensure operational transparency** across the organization.  
It features **module-based navigation** 🔀, **sortable and filterable data tables** 📋, and clear **visual feedback** for loading ⏳ and error ⚠️ states — all designed to simplify monitoring workflows.

Technically, the dashboard leverages **Next.js** for server-side rendering and performance optimization ⚡, **React** for modular UI management, **TypeScript** for type-safe development 🧩, and a combination of **Material UI (MUI)** and **Tailwind CSS** 🎨 for a responsive, modern interface.  
Data is fetched dynamically using **Axios** 🌐 from a custom API endpoint, ensuring up-to-date log information and seamless user interaction 🔄.
