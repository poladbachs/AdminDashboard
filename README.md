## Project Overview

Admin Dashboard is a centralized internal log viewer platform built with **Next.js and React.js**. It provides admins and developers with a unified interface to **view, filter, and analyze logs** generated by different company modules, including the **Backend (Django)**, **Website**, and **Database** systems.

The application enables real-time visibility into system activity, making it easier to **track deployments, detect issues, and ensure operational transparency** across the organization. It features module-based navigation, sortable and filterable data tables, and clear visual feedback for loading and error states — all designed to simplify monitoring workflows.

Technically, the dashboard leverages **Next.js** for server-side rendering and performance optimization, **React** for modular UI management, **TypeScript** for type-safe development, and a combination of **Material UI (MUI)** and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, modern interface. Data is fetched dynamically using **Axios** from a custom API endpoint, ensuring up-to-date log information and seamless user interaction.

## Features

- **Module Navigation**: Switch between viewing logs for specific modules using a sidebar.
- **Date Sorting**: Sort log entries by date to view either the latest or oldest entries.
- **Server and Author Filtering**: Filter logs by server type and sort by author in alphabetical order.
- **Dynamic Log Display**: Log data is displayed in a table format, with columns for date, time, server, author, current hash, and previous hash.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator is displayed with a corresponding message while data is being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if log data is empty, tailored to the selected server and module.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** and **Next.js** for component-based architecture and server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript** for type-safe coding and improved maintainability.
- **Material UI (MUI)** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive UI design.
- **Axios** for handling HTTP requests, specifically in server-side data fetching with Next.js.

## What I Did in This Project

In the **Admin Dashboard** project, I implemented:

- **Server-Side Data Fetching with Axios**:
  - Leveraged **Next.js** server-side features to fetch data from an API using **Axios**, ensuring optimized performance.
  
- **Component-Based Layout**:
  - Built reusable components such as `Sidebar`, `Dashboard`, and `Filters` for modular and maintainable code, rather than stacking everything within a single page component.
  
- **Data Filtering and Sorting**:
  - Enabled filtering of log entries by date, server type, and author.
  - Added date and author sorting options to customize the log viewing experience.
  
- **Dynamic and Interactive UI**:
  - Used **MUI** and **Tailwind CSS** for flexible styling to create a visually appealing and responsive interface.
  - Developed an interactive sidebar for easy module selection, improving navigation and user experience.
  
- **User Feedback**:
  - Implemented loading state messaging and error handling to inform users about data-fetching statuses or issues.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates advanced usage of **Next.js**, **React**, and modern UI libraries to build a feature-rich and highly interactive web application. The Admin Dashboard serves as a practical example of creating scalable and user-friendly applications that are both responsive and visually appealing.
